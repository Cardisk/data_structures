# data_structures

### *INFO*

Some cute data structures written in C language.

`stretchy_buffer.h` is a simple dynamic array implementation that extends the 
functionalities of the ones provided by the language itself.

`hash_map.h` is a pretty dumb implementation of an hash table. Logically this is not
the best and the strongest implementation ever but it does its job so...

Maybe I will add other structures here in the future.
